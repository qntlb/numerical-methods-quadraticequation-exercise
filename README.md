# numerical-methods-computerarithmetic-exercise

In this exercise there are two parts related to computer arithmetic:

## Quadratic Equation Solver

Implement a class with the follwoing properties:

- It implement the interface `QuadraticEquation` of the package `info.quantlab.numericalmethods.lecture.computerarithmetics`.
- It has a constructor consuming a `double[]` array of length 2 representing the coefficients a_0 and a_1 of x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0.
- The methods of the interface are implemented according to their specification in the JavaDoc.


## Summation

Implement a class with the follwoing properties:

- It implement the interface `DoubleVector` of the package `info.quantlab.numericalmethods.lecture.computerarithmetics`.
- It has a constructor consuming a `double[]` array representing the elements of a vector.
- The methods of the interface are implemented according to their specification in the JavaDoc. that is method getSum() returns the sum of the elements of the array.

Then, run the corresponding unit test to test your implementation.
